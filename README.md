# Designing Hall crystals with variable Chern numbers
This repo contains code needed to generate the figures of https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03888. In particular, this code reproduces Figure 3 (Fig3a.ipynb, Fig3b.ipynb, Fig3c.ipynb) and some figures in the Supplemental Material (FigSM.ipynb). The dataset Î»=0.5_N=150_d=40.jld2 needed for Fig3b.ipynb is found [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16755488).
